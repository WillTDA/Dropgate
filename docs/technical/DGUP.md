# DGUP — Dropgate Upload Protocol

**Protocol Version:** 3
**Status:** Stable
**Last Updated:** February 2026

---

## 1. Overview

The Dropgate Upload Protocol (DGUP) defines the client–server mechanism for transferring files to a Dropgate Server instance. DGUP handles single-file and multi-file (bundle) uploads with optional end-to-end encryption (E2EE), chunk-level integrity verification, and automatic lifecycle management.

DGUP is transport-agnostic in principle but is presently implemented over HTTPS. All payloads are JSON unless otherwise stated.

### 1.1 Design Goals

- **Integrity** — every chunk is verified against a SHA-256 digest before it is persisted.
- **Confidentiality** — optional AES-256-GCM encryption ensures the server never sees plaintext file content or filenames.
- **Resilience** — chunk-level retries with exponential back-off tolerate transient network failures.
- **Quota Safety** — storage reservations are acquired under a mutex before any bytes are written, preventing time-of-check/time-of-use races.
- **Simplicity** — the protocol uses standard HTTP methods and headers; no WebSocket or long-polling is required for uploads.

---

## 2. Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Chunk** | A contiguous byte range of the source file, optionally encrypted. |
| **Upload Session** | A stateful server-side context that tracks chunk reception for a single file. |
| **Bundle** | A logical grouping of two or more files uploaded as a single unit. |
| **Sealed Bundle** | An encrypted bundle whose manifest is an opaque, client-encrypted blob. The server cannot enumerate member files. |
| **Unsealed Bundle** | An unencrypted bundle whose file list is stored in plaintext on the server. |
| **File ID** | A UUID v4 assigned on upload completion. Used in download URLs. |
| **Upload ID** | A UUID v4 assigned on upload initialisation. Used only during the upload session and discarded afterwards. |

---

## 3. Capability Discovery

Before initiating an upload, the client MUST query the server's capabilities.

### 3.1 Request

```
GET /api/info
```

No authentication is required.

### 3.2 Response

A JSON object containing (at minimum):

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `version` | `string` | Server version (semver). |
| `capabilities.upload.enabled` | `boolean` | Whether DGUP is available. |
| `capabilities.upload.e2ee` | `boolean` | Whether E2EE is supported. |
| `capabilities.upload.maxFileSizeBytes` | `number` | Maximum file size in bytes (0 = unlimited). |
| `capabilities.upload.maxLifetimeMs` | `number` | Maximum permitted file lifetime in milliseconds. |
| `capabilities.upload.maxDownloads` | `number` | Server-enforced maximum download limit. |
| `capabilities.upload.chunkSizeBytes` | `number` | Server's expected chunk size. |
| `capabilities.upload.bundleSizeMode` | `string` | `"total"` or `"per-file"` — how bundle size limits are applied. |

### 3.3 Compatibility

The client SHOULD compare its own version against the server version. Major version mismatches SHOULD be treated as incompatible. The client SHOULD respect `chunkSizeBytes` and all declared limits.

---

## 4. Encryption Layer

When E2EE is enabled, DGUP encrypts file content and filenames client-side before any data is transmitted. The server stores only ciphertext and has no mechanism to recover plaintext.

### 4.1 Algorithm

- **Cipher:** AES-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode).
- **Key length:** 256 bits.
- **IV (Initialisation Vector):** 12 bytes, cryptographically random, unique per chunk.
- **Authentication tag:** 16 bytes (appended to ciphertext by AES-GCM).

### 4.2 Key Generation

The client generates a fresh AES-256 key via the Web Crypto API (`crypto.subtle.generateKey`). The key is exported to a URL-safe Base64 string for inclusion in the download link fragment.

### 4.3 Filename Encryption

The original filename is encrypted with the same AES-GCM key and a separate random IV. The resulting ciphertext is Base64-encoded and transmitted in place of the plaintext filename.

### 4.4 Chunk Encryption

For each chunk:

1. A fresh 12-byte IV is generated.
2. The plaintext chunk is encrypted with AES-GCM using the session key and IV.
3. The output blob is: `IV (12 bytes) || ciphertext || authentication tag (16 bytes)`.
4. Encryption overhead per chunk is therefore **28 bytes**.

### 4.5 Key Transmission

The encryption key is **never** sent to the server. It is appended to the download URL as a fragment identifier (`#<keyBase64>`). URL fragments are not included in HTTP requests and are therefore invisible to the server and any intermediate proxies.

### 4.6 Secure Context Requirement

E2EE requires the Web Crypto API, which is only available in secure contexts (HTTPS or `localhost`). If the client cannot obtain a secure context, E2EE MUST be disabled or the upload MUST be rejected.

---

## 5. Upload Initialisation

### 5.1 Single-File Upload

```
POST /upload/init
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Request body:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `filename` | `string` | Yes | Plaintext or encrypted filename. |
| `totalSize` | `number` | Yes | Total size in bytes (including encryption overhead if applicable). |
| `totalChunks` | `number` | Yes | Number of chunks the file will be split into. |
| `isEncrypted` | `boolean` | Yes | Whether the payload is E2EE-encrypted. |
| `lifetime` | `number` | No | Requested lifetime in milliseconds. 0 or omitted = server default. |
| `maxDownloads` | `number` | No | Requested download limit. 0 = unlimited. |

**Server validation:**

1. `filename` MUST be non-empty and MUST NOT contain null bytes or control characters (unless encrypted).
2. Unencrypted filenames are checked for reserved OS names and path-traversal sequences.
3. Unencrypted filenames MUST NOT exceed 255 characters.
4. `totalSize` MUST NOT exceed the server's declared maximum file size.
5. `totalChunks` MUST NOT exceed 100,000.
6. `totalChunks` MUST be consistent with `totalSize` and the server's chunk size (±1 for rounding).
7. `lifetime` MUST NOT exceed the server's declared maximum lifetime.
8. `maxDownloads` MUST NOT exceed the server's declared maximum download limit.
9. Available storage quota is checked atomically under a mutex.

**Response (200):**

```json
{
  "uploadId": "<uuid>"
}
```

The server creates a temporary file at its configured upload path and reserves the declared bytes against the storage quota.

### 5.2 Bundle Upload

```
POST /upload/init-bundle
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Request body:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `fileCount` | `number` | Yes | Number of files (≥ 2, ≤ 1,000). |
| `files` | `array` | Yes | Array of `{ filename, totalSize, totalChunks }` per file. |
| `isEncrypted` | `boolean` | Yes | Whether the bundle is E2EE-encrypted. |
| `lifetime` | `number` | No | Requested lifetime. |
| `maxDownloads` | `number` | No | Download limit applied at the bundle level. |

**Response (200):**

```json
{
  "bundleUploadId": "<uuid>",
  "fileUploadIds": ["<uuid>", "<uuid>", "..."]
}
```

Each file in the bundle receives its own upload ID and is uploaded independently using the chunk mechanism described below.

### 5.3 Session Expiry

- **Single-file sessions** expire after **2 minutes** of inactivity.
- **Bundle sessions** expire after **2 minutes** of inactivity.
- Each successful chunk upload resets the inactivity timer for the upload session, the parent bundle session (if applicable), and all sibling upload sessions within the same bundle.

---

## 6. Chunk Upload

### 6.1 Request

```
POST /upload/chunk
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
X-Upload-ID: <uploadId>
X-Chunk-Index: <0-based integer>
X-Chunk-Hash: <sha-256 hex digest>
```

The request body is the raw chunk bytes (encrypted or plaintext).

### 6.2 Chunk Sizing

The default chunk size is **5,242,880 bytes** (5 MiB). The server MAY advertise a different chunk size via `/api/info`. The minimum permitted chunk size is **65,536 bytes** (64 KiB).

For encrypted uploads, each chunk's on-wire size includes the 28-byte encryption overhead.

### 6.3 Server-Side Processing

1. The upload ID is validated against active sessions.
2. The chunk index is validated (0 ≤ index < totalChunks).
3. The chunk is checked for duplication — if already received, the request is rejected.
4. The SHA-256 digest of the received bytes is computed and compared to `X-Chunk-Hash`.
5. The chunk is written to the temporary file at the calculated byte offset.
6. The session's inactivity timer is reset.

### 6.4 Integrity Verification

The SHA-256 hash in `X-Chunk-Hash` MUST be a 64-character lowercase hexadecimal string. The server independently hashes the received chunk and rejects it if the digests do not match. This guards against data corruption in transit.

### 6.5 Responses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `200` | Chunk accepted. |
| `400` | Invalid chunk index, hash format, or duplicate chunk. |
| `410` | Upload session expired or not found. |
| `413` | Chunk exceeds expected size. |
| `500` | File I/O error. |

---

## 7. Retry Strategy

Clients SHOULD implement automatic retries for transient failures.

### 7.1 Recommended Defaults

| Parameter | Default |
|-----------|---------|
| Maximum retries per chunk | 5 |
| Initial back-off | 1,000 ms |
| Back-off multiplier | 2× |
| Maximum back-off | 30,000 ms |
| Per-chunk timeout | 60,000 ms |

### 7.2 Non-Retryable Errors

- **Abort errors** (user cancellation) — fail immediately.
- **Validation errors** (4xx) — retrying will not help; fail immediately.
- **Storage quota exceeded** (507) — fail immediately.

---

## 8. Upload Completion

### 8.1 Single File

```
POST /upload/complete
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "uploadId": "<uuid>"
}
```

**Server validation:**

1. All chunks MUST have been received (exact count match).
2. The temporary file's byte size MUST match the declared `totalSize`.
3. Zero-byte files are rejected.

**On success:**

1. The temporary file is renamed to a permanent path identified by a new UUID (the **File ID**).
2. A database record is created with: filename, path, encryption flag, download limit, download count (0), and expiry timestamp.
3. The storage quota counter is updated.

**Response (200):**

```json
{
  "id": "<fileId>"
}
```

### 8.2 Bundle

```
POST /upload/complete-bundle
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "bundleUploadId": "<uuid>",
  "encryptedManifest": "<base64>"  // Only for sealed (encrypted) bundles
}
```

For **sealed bundles**, the `encryptedManifest` is an opaque Base64-encoded blob encrypted by the client. The server stores it verbatim. Only the holder of the encryption key can read the manifest.

For **unsealed bundles**, the server assembles the file list from the completed uploads.

**Response (200):**

```json
{
  "bundleId": "<uuid>"
}
```

---

## 9. Upload Cancellation

```
POST /upload/cancel
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "uploadId": "<uuid>"
}
```

The server deletes the temporary file, releases the storage reservation, and removes the session.

---

## 10. Download Link Format

| Upload Type | URL Format |
|-------------|------------|
| Single file (unencrypted) | `https://<host>/<fileId>` |
| Single file (encrypted) | `https://<host>/<fileId>#<keyBase64>` |
| Bundle (unencrypted) | `https://<host>/b/<bundleId>` |
| Bundle (encrypted) | `https://<host>/b/<bundleId>#<keyBase64>` |

The fragment identifier (`#<keyBase64>`) is processed exclusively by the client. It is never transmitted to the server.

---

## 11. File Retrieval

### 11.1 Metadata

```
GET /api/file/<fileId>/meta
```

Returns file size, encryption flag, and either the plaintext filename or the encrypted filename blob.

```
GET /api/bundle/<bundleId>/meta
```

Returns bundle metadata. For sealed bundles, this includes only the encrypted manifest. For unsealed bundles, this includes the full file list.

### 11.2 Download

```
GET /api/file/<fileId>
```

Streams the raw file bytes. For encrypted files, the client decrypts the stream by reading each chunk's 12-byte IV prefix, decrypting the ciphertext with AES-GCM, and stripping the authentication tag.

### 11.3 Download Counting

- For **single files**, the download count is incremented after the stream completes.
- For **bundles**, the client calls `POST /api/bundle/<bundleId>/downloaded` once all member files have been retrieved.
- When `downloadCount >= maxDownloads` (and `maxDownloads > 0`), the file or bundle is immediately deleted.

---

## 12. Lifecycle Management

### 12.1 Expiry

Files and bundles are automatically deleted once their `expiresAt` timestamp is reached. The server runs a cleanup task every **60 seconds**.

### 12.2 Zombie Upload Cleanup

Incomplete upload sessions (where chunks are no longer arriving) are cleaned every **5 minutes** by default (configurable). Temporary files are deleted and storage reservations are released.

### 12.3 Server Restart Behaviour

By default, all uploads and temporary files are cleared on server restart. If `UPLOAD_PRESERVE_UPLOADS` is set to `true`, the server uses SQLite-backed persistence and retains both files and metadata across restarts.

---

## 13. Error Model

All error responses follow a consistent JSON structure:

```json
{
  "error": "<human-readable message>"
}
```

### 13.1 Status Codes

| Code | Context |
|------|---------|
| `200` | Success. |
| `400` | Validation failure (malformed request, invalid parameters). |
| `404` | File, bundle, or upload session not found. |
| `410` | Upload session expired. |
| `413` | File or chunk exceeds size limit. |
| `429` | Rate limit exceeded. |
| `500` | Internal server error. |
| `507` | Insufficient storage quota. |

---

## 14. Rate Limiting

The server enforces a request rate limit to protect against abuse. The defaults are:

| Parameter | Default |
|-----------|---------|
| Window | 60,000 ms |
| Maximum requests per window | 25 |

Rate limits are applied per IP address. When triggered, the server responds with HTTP 429.

---

## 15. Constraints Summary

| Aspect | Default | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Chunk size | 5 MiB | Minimum 64 KiB; server-configurable. |
| Maximum file size | 100 MiB | 0 = unlimited; server-configurable. |
| Maximum chunk count | 100,000 | Hard limit to prevent abuse. |
| Maximum bundle file count | 1,000 | Hard limit. |
| Maximum filename length | 255 chars | Unencrypted files only. |
| Default lifetime | 24 hours | Server-configurable. |
| Default max downloads | 1 | Server-configurable; 0 = unlimited. |
| Storage quota | 10 GiB | Server-configurable. |
| Encrypted manifest size | 1 MiB max | Sealed bundles only. |
| Upload session timeout | 2 minutes | Per-chunk inactivity. |
| Bundle session timeout | 2 minutes | Per-chunk inactivity (same as upload sessions). |
| IV size | 12 bytes | AES-GCM standard. |
| Authentication tag size | 16 bytes | AES-GCM standard. |
| Key size | 256 bits | AES-256. |

## 16. Best Practices

### 16.1 Server Deployment

- **Always deploy behind a reverse proxy that terminates TLS.** DGUP's E2EE features require HTTPS. Self-signed certificates are acceptable for private deployments but reduce trust for external users.
- **Set `UPLOAD_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` and `UPLOAD_MAX_STORAGE_GB` to sensible values.** Unbounded storage invites abuse.
- **Set `UPLOAD_MAX_FILE_LIFETIME_HOURS` conservatively.** Shorter lifetimes reduce exposure if a server is compromised.
- **Keep `UPLOAD_PRESERVE_UPLOADS=false` unless persistence is specifically required.** Non-persistent mode ensures a clean slate on each server restart, minimising the window during which uploaded data is at rest.
- **Enable rate limiting.** The defaults (25 requests per 60 seconds) are a reasonable starting point. Adjust based on expected traffic.
- **Avoid enabling `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` in production.** Debug logging may include chunk-level metadata that, in aggregate, reveals transfer patterns.

### 16.2 Client Behaviour

- **Always enable E2EE when the server supports it.** There is no meaningful performance penalty and it ensures the server operator cannot access file content.
- **Respect the server's advertised chunk size.** Mismatched chunk sizes will cause upload failures.
- **Implement retry logic.** Transient network failures are common; the recommended exponential back-off strategy prevents overwhelming the server.
- **Do not store encryption keys on the server or in server-accessible storage.** The key belongs exclusively in the download URL fragment.
- **Validate server certificates when connecting over HTTPS.** Disabling certificate verification defeats the purpose of TLS.

### 16.3 Network Privacy

- **Consider using a VPN when connecting to a Dropgate Server**, particularly for sensitive transfers. A VPN prevents the server operator and network intermediaries from observing the client's real IP address. If the VPN provider supports peer-to-peer traffic, the same VPN connection can protect both DGUP uploads and DGDTP transfers. Research VPN providers carefully — the privacy properties of a VPN are only as strong as the provider's logging and jurisdiction policies.
