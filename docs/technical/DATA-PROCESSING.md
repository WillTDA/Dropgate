# Dropgate Data Processing

**Last Updated:** February 2026

This document describes what data Dropgate collects, where and why it is stored, how it is processed, and when it is deleted. It covers all three components of the monorepo: the Dropgate Server, the Dropgate Client (Electron), and the `dropgate-core` library (which is also used in the Web UI).

---

## 1. Principles

Dropgate follows a data-minimisation approach:

- **No user accounts or authentication.** There is no concept of a registered user. No usernames, passwords, email addresses, or tokens are collected.
- **No tracking or analytics.** Dropgate does not embed analytics scripts, tracking pixels, or third-party telemetry.
- **No cookies.** Neither the server nor the Web UI sets any cookies.
- **No persistent client-side web storage.** The Web UI does not use `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, or `IndexedDB`.
- **Encryption by default.** When E2EE is enabled (the default), the server stores only ciphertext and has no mechanism to recover plaintext file content or filenames.

---

## 2. Data Inventory

The following tables enumerate every category of data processed by Dropgate, grouped by component.

### 2.1 Dropgate Server — Upload Protocol (DGUP)

| Data | Stored? | Where | Why | When Created | When Deleted |
|------|---------|-------|-----|--------------|--------------|
| **File content** (plaintext or ciphertext) | Yes | Filesystem: `/uploads/<fileId>` | Core purpose — the file must be persisted so recipients can download it. | On upload completion (`/upload/complete`). | On expiry, max downloads reached, or server restart (unless `UPLOAD_PRESERVE_UPLOADS=true`). |
| **Temporary file** (partial chunks) | Yes | Filesystem: `/uploads/tmp/<uploadId>` | Chunks must be written to disk as they arrive; holding them in memory would be infeasible for large files. | On upload initialisation (`/upload/init`). | On upload completion (renamed), cancellation, zombie cleanup, or server restart. |
| **Filename** | Yes | Database (in-memory or SQLite) | Required to set `Content-Disposition` on download. For encrypted uploads, the stored value is a Base64-encoded ciphertext blob — the server cannot read it. | On upload completion. | When the file record is deleted. |
| **File size** (bytes) | Yes | Database | Used for storage quota accounting, `Content-Length` headers, and progress reporting to download clients. | On upload completion. | When the file record is deleted. |
| **Encryption flag** (`isEncrypted`) | Yes | Database | Determines how the server serves the file (headers, MIME type, secure-context enforcement). | On upload completion. | When the file record is deleted. |
| **Download count** | Yes | Database | Enforces the maximum-download limit. Only stored when `maxDownloads > 0`. | On first download. Incremented on each subsequent download. | When the file record is deleted. |
| **Maximum downloads** | Yes | Database | Reference value for the download-count check. | On upload completion. | When the file record is deleted. |
| **Expiry timestamp** (`expiresAt`) | Yes | Database | Drives automatic deletion. `null` if no expiry. | On upload completion. | When the file record is deleted. |
| **File ID** (UUID) | Yes | Database (as key) | Unique identifier used in download URLs. | On upload completion. | When the file record is deleted. |
| **Upload ID** (UUID) | Temporarily | In-memory (`ongoingUploads` Map) | Tracks the upload session whilst chunks are being received. | On upload initialisation. | On completion, cancellation, zombie cleanup, or server restart. |
| **Received chunk indices** | Temporarily | In-memory (Set within upload session) | Detects duplicate chunks and validates completeness. | On each chunk upload. | When the upload session ends. |
| **Reserved storage bytes** | Temporarily | In-memory (quota counter) | Prevents TOCTOU race conditions during concurrent uploads. | On upload initialisation (under mutex). | Released on completion, cancellation, or zombie cleanup. |
| **Chunk hash** (SHA-256) | No | — | Verified on receipt and discarded. Not persisted. | — | — |

### 2.2 Dropgate Server — Bundle Data

| Data | Stored? | Where | Why | When Created | When Deleted |
|------|---------|-------|-----|--------------|--------------|
| **Bundle ID** (UUID) | Yes | Database (as key) | Unique identifier for the bundle download URL. | On bundle completion. | On expiry or max downloads reached. |
| **Encrypted manifest** (sealed bundles) | Yes | Database (Base64 blob, ≤ 1 MiB) | Allows the download client to enumerate files in the bundle. The server stores it as an opaque blob and cannot read it. | On bundle completion. | On expiry or max downloads reached. |
| **Plaintext file list** (unsealed bundles) | Yes | Database (JSON array of `{ fileId, name, sizeBytes }`) | Allows the server to serve the bundle download page and enumerate member files. | On bundle completion. | On expiry or max downloads reached. |
| **Bundle upload ID** (UUID) | Temporarily | In-memory (`ongoingBundles` Map) | Tracks the bundle session whilst individual files are being uploaded. | On bundle initialisation. | On bundle completion or zombie cleanup. |

### 2.3 Dropgate Server — P2P Signalling (DGDTP)

| Data | Stored? | Where | Why | When Created | When Deleted |
|------|---------|-------|-----|--------------|--------------|
| **Peer IDs** (P2P codes) | Transiently | PeerJS in-memory (not Dropgate-managed) | Peer discovery and routing. | On peer registration. | On peer disconnection. |
| **ICE candidates** | Transiently | PeerJS in-memory (not Dropgate-managed) | NAT traversal — relayed between peers during WebRTC connection setup. Contains IP addresses and ports. | During ICE gathering. | On connection establishment or failure. |
| **SDP offers/answers** | Transiently | PeerJS in-memory (not Dropgate-managed) | WebRTC session negotiation. | During connection setup. | On connection establishment or failure. |
| **File content** | **Never** | — | File data flows directly between peers via the WebRTC data channel. The server is not involved. | — | — |
| **File metadata** (name, size, MIME) | **Never** | — | Exchanged between peers over the encrypted data channel. The server cannot observe it. | — | — |

### 2.4 Dropgate Server — HTTP Request Metadata

| Data | Stored? | Where | Why | When Created | When Deleted |
|------|---------|-------|-----|--------------|--------------|
| **Client IP address** | Transiently | In-memory (rate limiter) | Rate limiting. Tracked per sliding window by `express-rate-limit`. Not written to disk or database. | On each HTTP request. | When the rate-limit window expires (default: 60 seconds). |
| **User-Agent header** | **No** | — | Present in HTTP requests but not logged, stored, or processed by Dropgate. | — | — |
| **Request paths and methods** | **No** (unless logging) | stdout/stderr (if `LOG_LEVEL ≥ INFO`) | Operational logging. Not structured or persisted by Dropgate itself. Persistence depends on the server operator's log infrastructure. | On relevant server events. | Determined by operator's log retention policy. |

### 2.5 Dropgate Client (Electron)

| Data | Stored? | Where | Why | When Created | When Deleted |
|------|---------|-------|-----|--------------|--------------|
| **Server URL** | Yes | `electron-store` (`config.json` in user data directory) | Remembers the user's preferred server between sessions. | On user input (settings form). | On user change or application uninstall. |
| **Lifetime preference** (value + unit) | Yes | `electron-store` | Remembers the user's preferred file lifetime. | On user input. | On user change or application uninstall. |
| **Max downloads preference** | Yes | `electron-store` | Remembers the user's preferred download limit. | On user input. | On user change or application uninstall. |
| **Window bounds** (x, y, width, height) | Yes | `electron-store` | Restores window position and size between sessions. | On window move/resize. | On application uninstall. |
| **Debug log** | Yes | `{userData}/debug.log` | Troubleshooting application issues. Contains timestamps, process arguments, app lifecycle events, and upload progress. Does not contain file content or encryption keys. | On application start. | Manual deletion by user. |

### 2.6 Web UI (Browser)

| Data | Stored? | Where | Why | When Created | When Deleted |
|------|---------|-------|-----|--------------|--------------|
| **Server capabilities** | Transiently | JavaScript memory | Cached `/api/info` response for the current page session. | On connection test. | On page unload. |
| **File references** | Transiently | JavaScript memory (`File` objects) | The user's selected files, held in memory for upload. | On file selection. | On page unload or upload completion. |
| **Transfer progress** | Transiently | JavaScript memory | Percentage, bytes transferred, etc. | During upload/P2P transfer. | On page unload or transfer completion. |

## 3. Encryption and Key Handling

### 3.1 What Is Encrypted

When E2EE is active:

- **File content** — encrypted with AES-256-GCM before leaving the client.
- **Filenames** — encrypted with the same key and a separate IV.
- **Bundle manifests** (sealed bundles) — encrypted client-side; the server stores an opaque blob.

### 3.2 What Is NOT Encrypted

Even with E2EE active, the following metadata is visible to the server:

- File size (including encryption overhead).
- Number of chunks.
- Whether the file is encrypted (`isEncrypted` flag).
- Expiry timestamp and download limits.
- Upload timing patterns (when chunks arrive).

### 3.3 Key Lifecycle

1. **Generated** by the client using `crypto.subtle.generateKey`.
2. **Used** to encrypt all chunks and the filename.
3. **Exported** to URL-safe Base64 and appended to the download URL as a fragment (`#<keyBase64>`).
4. **Never transmitted to the server.** URL fragments are not included in HTTP requests.
5. **Not persisted** by the client. The key exists only in the download link. If the link is lost, the file cannot be decrypted.

### 3.4 Server's Cryptographic Capabilities

The server has no access to encryption keys and therefore **cannot**:

- Decrypt file content.
- Read original filenames (when encrypted).
- Read sealed bundle manifests.
- Recover keys from stored data.

## 4. Data Storage Locations

### 4.1 Server Filesystem

```
/uploads/                    Main upload directory
  ├── <fileId>               Completed files (UUID names, no extensions)
  ├── tmp/
  │   └── <uploadId>         Temporary files during upload
  └── db/                    Only if UPLOAD_PRESERVE_UPLOADS=true
      ├── file-database.sqlite
      └── bundle-database.sqlite
```

### 4.2 Server Memory

| Structure | Contents | Lifetime |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| `ongoingUploads` (Map) | Active upload sessions. | Until completion, cancellation, or zombie cleanup. |
| `ongoingBundles` (Map) | Active bundle sessions. | Until bundle completion or zombie cleanup. |
| Rate limiter store | IP → request count mappings. | Sliding window (default 60 s). |
| File/bundle database | File/bundle metadata. | Persistent (SQLite) or until restart (in-memory). |
| PeerJS state | Peer connections, ICE candidates, SDP. | Until peer disconnection. |

### 4.3 Database Persistence Modes

| `UPLOAD_PRESERVE_UPLOADS` | Database Driver | Behaviour on Restart |
|---------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| `false` (default) | In-memory | All metadata lost. All files in `/uploads/` deleted. |
| `true` | SQLite (`/uploads/db/`) | Metadata and files preserved. Only `/uploads/tmp/` is cleaned. |

---

## 5. Data Deletion Triggers

### 5.1 Automatic Deletion

| Trigger | What Is Deleted | Frequency |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| **File expiry** (`expiresAt < now`) | File from disk + database record. | Checked every **60 seconds**. |
| **Bundle expiry** | Sealed: manifest record. Unsealed: all member files + manifest. | Checked every **60 seconds**. |
| **Max downloads reached** | Single file: file + record. Unsealed bundle: all member files + manifest. Sealed bundle: manifest record only. | Immediately after the triggering download. |
| **Zombie upload cleanup** | Temporary file + storage reservation + session state. | Every **5 minutes** (configurable via `UPLOAD_ZOMBIE_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MS`). |
| **Server restart** (non-persistent mode) | All files, temporary files, and in-memory data. | On process start. |
| **Server restart** (persistent mode) | Only temporary files in `/uploads/tmp/`. | On process start. |

### 5.2 User-Initiated Deletion

| Action | What Is Deleted |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Upload cancellation** (`POST /upload/cancel`) | Temporary file, storage reservation, session state. |
| **P2P transfer cancellation** (either peer calls `stop()`) | Connection resources. No server data to delete (DGDTP stores nothing on the server). |

### 5.3 What Is NOT Automatically Deleted

- **Electron client settings** (`electron-store`) — persist until the user changes them or uninstalls the application.
- **Electron debug log** — persists until manually deleted by the user.
- **Server operator logs** (stdout/stderr) — Dropgate has no control over log retention once data is written to the process output streams. This is the operator's responsibility.

## 8. Logging

### 8.1 Server Log Levels

| Level | Value | What Is Logged |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| `NONE` | -1 | Nothing. |
| `ERROR` | 0 | Errors only (file I/O failures, unhandled exceptions). |
| `WARN` | 1 | Warnings (deprecated features, recoverable issues). |
| `INFO` | 2 | Operational events: upload init, completion, deletion, rate limiting, capacity. **Default.** |
| `DEBUG` | 3 | Detailed diagnostics: chunk-level progress, validation rejections, size calculations. |

### 8.2 What Appears in Logs

**At `INFO` level (default):**

- Server startup configuration (port, enabled features, limits).
- Upload lifecycle events: "Initialised upload", "File received", "File expired".
- Storage capacity changes.
- Rate limit triggers.
- Bundle creation and deletion.

**At `DEBUG` level:**

- Chunk-level reception details (index, size).
- Validation rejection reasons.
- Storage quota calculations.

### 8.3 What Does NOT Appear in Logs

At any log level, Dropgate does **not** log:

- File content.
- Encryption keys.
- Plaintext filenames (encrypted filenames appear as Base64 blobs).
- Individual client IP addresses (the rate limiter tracks these in memory, but they are not written to log output by Dropgate).
- Download URLs.
- User-Agent strings.

### 8.4 PeerJS Debug Logging

When `PEERJS_DEBUG=true`, the PeerJS library outputs its own debug information to the console. This may include peer IDs (P2P codes) and connection state details. **Do not enable this in production** unless actively debugging P2P connectivity issues.

### 8.5 Operator Responsibility

Dropgate writes logs to stdout/stderr. Whether these logs are persisted, rotated, or forwarded to external systems is entirely under the server operator's control. Operators SHOULD:

- Set `LOG_LEVEL` to the minimum necessary for operational needs.
- Implement log rotation to avoid unbounded log growth.
- Consider the sensitivity of `DEBUG`-level output before enabling it.
- Be aware that reverse proxy access logs (e.g., Nginx, Caddy) may capture client IP addresses, request paths, and file IDs even if Dropgate itself does not log them.

---

## 9. Third-Party Data Exposure

### 9.1 STUN Servers

During DGDTP connection establishment, STUN binding requests are sent to the configured STUN server(s). These requests contain the sender's and receiver's IP addresses. The default STUN server is `stun:stun.cloudflare.com:3478`.

**Mitigation:** Self-host a STUN server to eliminate third-party IP exposure. Alternatively, use a VPN to mask real IP addresses before STUN requests are sent.

### 9.2 TURN Servers

If configured, TURN servers relay all WebRTC traffic. They see both peers' IP addresses and the volume of data transferred (but not its content, as it is DTLS-encrypted).

**Mitigation:** Self-host TURN servers for full control over relay infrastructure.

### 9.3 Reverse Proxies

A TLS-terminating reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy, etc.) sits between clients and the Dropgate Server. It sees:

- Client IP addresses.
- Request URLs (including file IDs, but not URL fragments containing encryption keys).
- Request and response sizes.
- TLS handshake metadata (SNI, client hello).

**Mitigation:** Configure the reverse proxy to minimise access logging. Be aware that file IDs in URLs are sufficient to construct download links (though not to decrypt encrypted files without the key fragment).

---

## 10. Best Practices for Data Handling

### 10.1 Server Operators

- **Use non-persistent mode (`UPLOAD_PRESERVE_UPLOADS=false`) unless persistence is required.** This ensures all data is cleared on server restart, reducing the window of exposure for data at rest.
- **Set conservative lifetimes and download limits.** Shorter lifetimes (`UPLOAD_MAX_FILE_LIFETIME_HOURS`) and low download counts (`UPLOAD_MAX_FILE_DOWNLOADS=1`) minimise the duration and accessibility of stored data.
- **Restrict storage quota.** A bounded `UPLOAD_MAX_STORAGE_GB` limits the volume of data that can accumulate.
- **Keep `LOG_LEVEL` at `INFO` or lower in production.** `DEBUG` logging includes chunk-level details that, in aggregate, reveal transfer patterns.
- **Disable `PEERJS_DEBUG` in production.** PeerJS debug output may include peer IDs and connection metadata.
- **Audit reverse proxy logs.** The reverse proxy may capture data that Dropgate itself does not log. Apply appropriate retention and access controls.
- **Review the `P2P_STUN_SERVERS` configuration.** If IP privacy is a concern, self-host STUN/TURN infrastructure rather than relying on third-party servers.

### 10.2 Users

- **Enable E2EE wherever possible.** When encryption is active, the server cannot access file content or filenames. There is no meaningful performance cost.
- **Share download links through secure channels.** The encryption key is embedded in the URL fragment. Anyone with the full URL can decrypt the file.
- **Use single-download mode (`maxDownloads=1`) for sensitive files.** The file is automatically deleted after one download, minimising exposure.
- **Use short lifetimes for sensitive files.** Even if the download limit is not reached, the file will be automatically deleted when the lifetime expires.
- **Consider using a VPN** when connecting to a Dropgate Server. This is particularly relevant for P2P transfers (DGDTP), where ICE candidates can expose real IP addresses. Choose a VPN provider that supports peer-to-peer traffic and research their privacy policies, logging practices, and jurisdiction carefully.
- **Prefer P2P (DGDTP) for the highest privacy.** When both sender and receiver are online simultaneously, DGDTP transfers file data directly between peers without it ever touching the server. The server's role is limited to initial signalling.
