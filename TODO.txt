- Upload drag and drop for UI should display a row for each file, with an X to remove it
- Fix icon alignment issues in file list (bundles)
- Fix zip name only using first part of UUID
- Bring multi-file upload to the Electron client
- Progress bar is not working for zip downloads

FOR BOTH PLAINTEXT AND E2EE INDIVIDUAL FILE DOWNLOADS FROM BUNDLES:
- SHOW A PROGRESS BAR FOR THE DOWNLOAD
- DON'T USE URLS FOR PLAINTEXT DOWNLOADS (put everything into dropgate core whereever possible, fallback to normal download otherwise, check for file's existence and display error if not available)
- HANDLE ERRORS GRACEFULLY AND PROVIDE UI FEEDBACK (not javascript alerts!)

FOR P2P BUNDLE DOWNLOADS:
- Keep it consistent by showing a collapsible file list (no individual downloads here though, too complicated for now)
- Name the zip after the peer code (dropgate-bundle-XXXX-0000.zip)
- Fix progress bar + text showing "0 / 0" on sender side.
