- Currently, bundle uploads are only limited by individual file size limits. By default, the Dropgate Server should limit total bundle size to UPLOAD_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB. Add an environment variable to choose between these two behaviours.
- Update UI text to clarify "max single file size" or "max upload size" where applicable, depending on the context. Apply to both client and server web UIs.
- P2P bundle sending appears broken. Not all files show up, or the bundle ZIP cannot be extracted on the device once received.
- Keep UI consistent with the web UI! Show file name for the upload status just like on the client.
- Clean up the drag/drop tables a bit - Have nice, modern reactive round X buttons, and divide each file in the table with a line. Apply to both client and server web UIs.
